# Astro Codrops

## Page Transitions

### Initial Thoughts

- why not use CSS layout transition
- why taxi
- what we'll be doing
  - few examples

#### How this is going to work

- we'll start from a bare example, that will dive into the more technical part and how our setup will work
- once past that, we'll dive into a few examples of implemented transitions without going through the basics, and just taking about the transition specific stuffs

### Basic Setup / Starter (001 - start)

We start from a pretty basic Astro setup, that's basically what comes out of running npm create astro@latest.

I've done some initial work and set up a few things:

- removed the basic components and created a new Nav.astro file to handle our navigation
- a styles.css file for general styling
- a src/modules/ folder, which is where we'll be writing most of our code.
- I've also slightly modified the Layout.astro, adding both the import for our newly created css file, the Nav component we created, and a script tag the way we want it.

### Page tranistion related setup (002 - initial setup)

I've kept this second part out as this is still setup, but related to handling and doing page transition.

You can check out Taxi.js, the library that we'll be using [here](https://taxi.js.org/).
At this date I consider this the more robust and structured library for this. It's made and maintained by [Jake Whiteley](https://x.com/jakewhiteleydev) (go give him a follow) and [Unseen Studio](https://unseen.co/).

In broad terms, this is the setup we'll need to go through

- Setting up the DOM structure and set up our project in a way that's going to work with that
- Creating the Pages javascript class which is going to be the handler for all our transition
- Handling a few edge cases of gotcha

#### How Taxi works

In simple terms, Taxi takes care of capturing your (internal) link clicks, overriding the standard behaviour, and instead of navigating to the next page, fetching it and inserting it in the DOM instead of the current page.

To do this it uses 2 containers, a wrapper, which is the target of the insertion, and the container that gets swapped. Ideally you want to have everything that you want to keep in all pages outside this container (ie a Nav).

Keep in mind, only what's inside the container will get swapped, so the persistent elements need to be present on all pages, including scripts and css files, so you're sure they are laoded regardless of the user's entry point.

Astro and Layouts are really convenient for this. We can set up the layout to manage all this, and work with the <slot> component to freely compose our pages.

#### Setting up the DOM

As you can find in the docs, the most minimal setup you need consist in marking a wrapper, which is the parent of the container that will get swapped, and marking the container.

```html
<main data-taxi>
  <article data-taxi-view>...</article>
</main>
```

looking at <body> tag inside the Layout.astro, the slot is where what we'll have in pages will be rendered, so are good just wrapping that component

```html
<!-- ... -->
<body>
  <nav />

  <slot />

  <script>
    import "../modules/app";
  </script>
</body>
```

```html
<!-- ... -->
<body>
  <nav />

  <main data-taxi>
    <div data-taxi-view>
      <slot />
    </div>
  </main>

  <script>
    import "../modules/app";
  </script>
</body>
```

We wrap the slot twice, once in a <main> tag with the `data-taxi` atrribute, and inside with a div (or anything you want) with the `data-taxi-view` attribute, that will wrap the swapped content.
